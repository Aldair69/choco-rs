## Goals

- **Modularity:** Each command is an independent module for easy maintenance and extensibility.
- **Language Support:** All user-facing strings use Fluent (`.ftl`) for i18n.
- **Transparency:** Open-source, allowing anyone to contribute or customize.
- **Community Friendly:** Clear contribution guidelines and modular code structure.

> ⚠️ Chocotorta is currently under active development.
